# password_manager
To run the program, user will need to have Java Eclipse installed. User will need to create a new Java Project with any name,
and will then need to have the Main.java, LoginPage.java, HomePage.java, AddEntry.java, EditEntry.java, CreateFile.java, and WriteToFile.java open in the src folder of the Java Project (default package is used).
User can then run the password manager to be directed to the login page from the Main.java file.
